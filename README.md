# Django-Online-Shop

In this chapter 7 of Django by example , I'm learning  how to build
the essential functionalities of an e-commerce platform. The online shop will enable
clients to browse products, add them to the cart, apply discount codes, go through
the checkout process, pay with a credit card, and obtain an invoice. I also
implemented a recommendation engine to recommend products to customers.

In Summary I learned how to:
• Create a product catalog
• Build a shopping cart using Django sessions
• Create custom context processors
• Manage customer orders
• Configure Celery in my project with RabbitMQ as a message broker
• Send asynchronous notifications to customers using Celery
• Monitor Celery using Flower
